DESCRIPTION:
This project is a web-based Hospital Readmission Predictor built using FastAPI and a machine learning model. It takes patient information such as age, number of lab procedures, medications, and time spent in the hospital to predict whether the patient is at high or low risk of being readmitted after discharge. The solution includes end-to-end data science componentsâ€”from data collection and preprocessing to model training and deployment. The model is trained using scikit-learn and served via a FastAPI backend, with a simple HTML interface for user input. The entire application can be deployed online (e.g., using Render) to make real-time predictions accessible through a web browser.
